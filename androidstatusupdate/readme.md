This example was for my son - who wanted his own Twitter-like solution for teams
of video game players.  It is obviously not complete.

What it does demonstrate is the use of a HTTP Basic Auth to make a connection
with POST and GET to a RESTful endpoint hosted on OpenShift.

It is related to this other example:
