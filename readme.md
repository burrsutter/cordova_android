A place for various Phonegap/Cordova Examples that I have hacked around in for testing various techniques, tools, APIs, etc.

androidhelloworld is a result of following the tutorial in docs/Cordova_Android_JBDS_v6.pdf (yes, v6 was my manual versioning system)

Note: These examples should all easily import into Eclipse Indigo or 
JBoss Developer Studio 5 with the Android Tools installed.
